# Data_Modelling_Cinema

- In the domain of cinema operations, the meticulous construction of a comprehensive database is crucial for streamlining the various components of the industry. 

- This database includes the management of films, directors, producers, screenings, tickets, actors, consumables, sessions, languages, cinemas, and categories.

- It serves as a repository for detailed information about films and the people behind their creation and is instrumental in managing the logistics of film screenings.

In this repository, we explore the architectural aspects of the database, outlining its primary components and relationships, and demonstrating its analytical capabilities through a range of queries. The database is designed to be normalized in 3NF to maintain simplicity in the model. It handles various facets of cinema operations, including films, directors, producers, screenings, tickets, actors, and consumables.
